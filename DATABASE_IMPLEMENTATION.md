# Database & Proposition System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's New

Your PISA app now has a **complete database system** for:
1. **Questions with Criteria** - Store propositions with difficulty, category, scoring rubric
2. **Answer Tracking** - Save all student answers with analysis results
3. **User History** - Retrieve past submissions with metadata

## 📊 Database Structure

### Firestore Collections

**`propositions/`** - Question bank
- Store questions with difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
- Define category (critical-thinking/problem-solving/analysis/comprehension)
- Include scoring rubric (excellent/good/fair/poor points + descriptions)
- Support multiple languages (Thai/English)

**`answers/{userId}/submissions/`** - Student responses
- Student's answer text / transcription
- Gemini AI analysis results
- Score assigned
- Proposition criteria snapshot (to track changes over time)
- Timestamps

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **First Time User Visits "Practice"**
```
1. Frontend calls initializeSamplePropositions()
2. Loads 3 Thai + 2 English sample questions to Firestore
3. Fetches random proposition for the user
4. User answers question (voice or text)
```

### 2. **Student Submits Answer**
```
Frontend Flow:
- User records/types answer
- Frontend loads current proposition
- Sends POST /analyzeAnswer with:
  ├── transcription (student's answer)
  ├── proposition object (full question data)
  ├── language (th/en)
  └── studentId

Backend Flow:
- Gemini AI analyzes answer (3x retry on 503/429)
- Saves to: answers/{{userId}}/submissions/{{docId}}
- Returns analysis immediately
- Uses proposition data to track scoring context
```

### 3. **Teacher/Admin Retrieves Results**
```
GET /userAnswerHistory?userId=student-123&limit=10

Returns:
- All student's past answers
- Question text for each
- Scores and analysis
- Thinking levels
- Timestamps
```

## 📝 Sample Propositions (Auto-Loaded)

## 🛠️ New API Endpoints

### Save Question (Admin)
```bash
POST /saveProposition
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "questionText": "...",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "category": "critical-thinking",
  "expectedAnswer": "...",
  "scoringRubric": {
    "excellent": { "points": 3, "description": "..." },
    "good": { "points": 2, "description": "..." }
  },
  "language": "th"
}
```

### Get Questions
```bash
GET /propositions?language=th
GET /propositions?language=en
```

### Get Student History
```bash
GET /userAnswerHistory?userId=student-123&limit=20

Returns all past answers with scores
```

### Analyze Answer (Updated)
```bash
POST /analyzeAnswer

{
  "transcription": "...",
  "questionId": "...",
  "referenceAnswer": "...",
  "studentId": "...",
  "proposition": {           // NEW: Full question data
    "id": "...",
    "difficulty": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "expectedAnswer": "...",
    "scoringRubric": {...}
  },
  "language": "th"          // NEW: User language
}
```

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (functions/src/)
- **database.ts**: Added `saveAnswerWithCriteria()`, `saveProposition()`, `getPropositions()`, `getUserAnswerHistory()`
- **analyzeAnswer.ts**: Now saves answers with proposition metadata
- **types.ts**: Added `PropositionData` and `ScoringRubric` types
- **index.ts**: New endpoints for proposition management

### Frontend Changes
- **propositionService.ts**: NEW - Handles proposition CRUD + initialization
  - `saveProposition()` - Create  new question
  - `getPropositions()` - Fetch all questions
  - `getRandomProposition()` - Get random question for practice
  - `initializeSamplePropositions()` - Auto-load sample questions
  - `SAMPLE_PROPOSITIONS_TH` & `SAMPLE_PROPOSITIONS_EN` - Pre-made questions

- **api.ts**: Updated `AnalyzeAnswerRequest` to include `proposition` and `language`
- **QuestionPage.tsx**: Now accepts proposition prop and passes to backend
- **MainApp.tsx**: Auto-initializes propositions on mount, loads random proposition for practice

### Data Storage
- All answers stored with **full metadata** for future analytics
- Proposition criteria **captured at submission time** (to track rubric changes)
- User history accessible via `GET /userAnswerHistory`
- Firestore free tier: **50,000 reads/writes per day** (plenty for pilot)

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Live Website**
Visit: https://reasonova.web.app
- Login with any email
- Go to "Practice" tab
- Should auto-load a random Thai question
- Answer it (voice or text)
- Analysis saves to database with proposition data

### 2. **Check Database**
Firebase Console → Firestore:
```
Collections to check:
- propositions/ (should have 3+ Thai + 2+ English)
- answers/
  └── userId/
      └── submissions/
          └── (submission documents with analysis)
```

### 3. **Retrieve History**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:10000/userAnswerHistory?userId=student-123"
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Test proposition loading
- ✅ Test answer submission with criteria
- ✅ Verify data appears in Firestore
- ✅ Check answer history endpoint

### Soon
- [ ] Create admin UI to add custom questions
- [ ] Add category filtering ("Show only critical thinking questions")
- [ ] Build progress dashboard (scores by category)
- [ ] Export student reports (all submissions + scores)
- [ ] Implement difficulty progression (easy → medium → hard)

### Future
- [ ] Question versioning (track rubric changes)
- [ ] A/B testing questions
- [ ] Difficulty scoring (questions that stump more students = harder rating)
- [ ] ML-based question recommendations
- [ ] Teacher dashboard with class analytics

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Public read:** Get propositions (questions are public)
- **Protected write:** Analyses (only authenticated students can submit)
- **User data:** Answers stored by user ID, only they can access their history
- **API keys:** GOOGLE_API_KEY secure in Render environment
